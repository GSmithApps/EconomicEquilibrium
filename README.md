# EconomicEquilibrium

This file is to illustrate some ideas in economic equilibrium. Specifically it was to find equilibrium between two actors with endowments and convex utility functions. If I remember correctly, there is a theorem that says with two actors and two convex utility functions, there is always a well-defined equilibrium. And this code finds it and illustrates it with a couple plots.
